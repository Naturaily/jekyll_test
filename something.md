Spread the word about the activities in your church to strengthen the relationship with your congregation. We believe churches play an important role in society and ChurchDesk helps you build and engage your community.

At ChurchDesk there are multiple ways to communicate your message. Keep a record of all the people your church engages with, and easily send relevant and targeted email newsletters and invites. You can send SMS messages with important updates to smaller groups, and easily maintain a church website that automatically displays your events.
